# ADPROC-Coursework
•	Write an application, which will allow the customer to enter the details of his/her order and will calculate the cost of the order. Your application should verify that FlexBox can supply the type of box requested (the customer should not be asked to specify the box type).

•	Use OO design approach (abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism) and create a class hierarchy that describes the types of boxes FlexBox sells.  Use an abstract class if necessary.

•	Give UML use case diagram, UML class hierarchy diagram, one class and one instance diagrams.

•	Use proper level of abstraction, encapsulation and accessibility for the class attributes and methods. Application with no levels of abstraction will fail.

•	Devise suitable test plan and data, which you can use to test the performance of your ordering system.
